Long time no see, everyone! Let's catch up a little â€” here's something cool I want to share with you ðŸ’–

## Soâ€¦ What is techtransthai?

[techtransthai.org](https://www.techtransthai.org), or *ttt-org* (the founder seems to really like calling it that for some reason, lol), is a Thai open source project community led by trans folks! It's honestly hard to describe â€” the best way to understand it is to check out the website yourself!

## Why did I join?

Wellâ€¦

- Iâ€™ve been interested in the project for a while now.
- Iâ€™ve already had lots of great conversations with the founder.
- I want to help revive and support the community.
- â€¦and honestly, it just feels right. ðŸ’«

Me and the founder have been getting along really well, and Iâ€™m excited to be part of something meaningful â€” both for myself and for the project. I really hope my contributions will help make a difference!

Thatâ€™s it for now â€” see you in the next blog post~! :3
